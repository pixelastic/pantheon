The Four Horsemen once bowed to him as their creator and ruler until they rebelled, bound him at the heart of Abaddon and devoured his flesh.\n\nThe Oinodaemon is rumoured to have more power than the other Four Horsemen combined although only the Horsemen know for sure. The Oinodaemon is mentioned only in whispers for fear of somehow awakening the shackled beast.",
