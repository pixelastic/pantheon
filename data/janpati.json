  "description": "Janpati dwells in the depths of Jansagar Lake, in the heart of the Crying Jungles. The mahajanapadas of the region protect it at her behest, for animals that drink from its waters are said to gain sapience. Thousands of sapient animals do actually populate the Janvari mahajanapada and Tendula, a panther rajah, rules over them. Janvari is also known as the seat of worship of Topimanu, the loyal monkey god who wields a mace.",
