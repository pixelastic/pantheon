  "description": "Easivra is a sun god who has been largely forgotten in Golarion. He was worshiped millennia ago in the Mwangi Expanse in a city known as Jaytirian, together with his rival, the demon lord Vyriavaxus. He represented the glory and power of the sun, the freedom of flight, and majesty of birds of prey.\n\nHis most powerful remnant on Golarion is an artifact known as the Morrowfall although numerous other relics feature depictions of a bright bird of prey facing off against a dark bat.\n\nHe is currently worshiped only by the sabosan, a race of nocturnal bat-like humanoids native to the Mwangi Expanse.",
