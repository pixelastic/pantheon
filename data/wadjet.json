Wadjet, a great river serpent said to dwell in the papyrus marshes of the River Sphinx delta, is a tutelary deity and mother of her emissaries, the uraeuses. Wadjet is the nurturer of the River Sphinx and a personification of the spirits guiding and guarding the ruler of Osirion. The rod of the uraeus is a magic item fashioned in the form of a uraeus-headed staff, which assists in the detection of deceit and can create a spray of stinging poison.",
