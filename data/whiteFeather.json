  "description": "The White Feather is the name of a guiding spirit or deity whose followers have recently emigrated to Qadira from the east. These monastic wanderers preach peaceful meditation, self-improvement, quiet contemplation, and the laying down of all trappings of societal status and material wealth. Their non-violent nature has brought them into conflict with Satrap Xerbystes II, who sees them as a distraction from his ambitions of a war with Taldor.",
