  "description": "Topimanu is a mace-wielding monkey god known for his loyalty. The center of his worship is the Janvari mahajanapada in the Crying Jungle, where the Jansagar Lake lies, protected by the surrounding mahajanapadas at the behest of the goddess Janpati, who dwells in the lake's depths. Rumours abound that animals that drink from the lake's waters gain sapience and thousands of sapient animals do actually populate the Janvari mahajanapada. There, they are ruled by Tendula, a panther rajah.",
