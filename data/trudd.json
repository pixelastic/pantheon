  "description": "Trudd is a deity almost entirely worshiped by dwarves. He is the youngest son of the primary dwarven deity, Torag. Despite his relatively young age, Trudd is the strongest deity in the dwarven pantheon, and as a result is often left to guard his father's halls while Torag is absent. For a dwarf, Trudd sports a remarkably short beard, spawning many tales, including one that he sold it for some unknown boon.",
