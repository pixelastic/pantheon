  "description": "Vudravati is a classic progenitor god, said to be the mother of all the Vudrani people. The Vudrani claim that the history of Vudra, and of Golarion as a whole, is told in the Mizravratta Brahmodya, dictated to the sage Balazastar by the goddess Likha. According to this account, as the goddess Vudravati walked across Golarion, she was courted by twin brothers Obari and Embaral. Though she took both as lovers, they fought so fiercely out of jealousy that Vudravati feared they would kill each other and wreak havoc across the world. To separate them until they could reconcile, she lay between them and went to sleep, her body forming the land of Vudra. She birthed children of both Obari and Embaral while in this slumber, who are believed to be the Vudrani peoples of today. This account claims that Vudra has been in existence longer than Golarion's continents were in their current places. Most foreign scholars, however, dismiss such claims as exaggeration.",
