  "description": "The goddess Naderi (sometimes Nadiri) was a divine assistant to Shelyn and was tasked with overseeing forbidden relationships among couples. She ascended to divinity when a young couple under her gaze decided to kill themselves instead of fighting the circumstances that forbade their love. Shocked by her apotheosis and afraid of how Shelyn would react, Naderi fled her mistress and finally became the goddess of suicides, particularly romantic tragedies. Shelyn has tried to fix this strange divide between the two of them, but has been unsuccessful due to unusual circumstances.",
