'''Abadar''' (pronounced AH-bah-dar),<ref name="CS-246">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|246}}</ref> the [[god]] of cities, [[law]], merchants, and wealth, is known to be a patient deity. Maintaining a strong [[Neutral (alignment axis)|neutral]] stance in his actions, he sets forth to expand civilization and order among the peoples of [[Golarion]].<ref name="PF8p64">{{Cite book/Seven Days to the Grave|64|64&ndash;71}}</ref><ref name="ISG-12-19">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Gods|12&ndash;19}}</ref>

== Dogma ==

Abadar and his followers wish to bring the light of civilization to the wilderness, to help educate all in the benefits of law and properly regulated commerce. He expects his followers to obey all meaningful laws, but not those which are ridiculous, unenforceable, or self-contradictory. He is also a great proponent of peace, as war inevitably leads to the degradation of trade and the stifling of prosperity for the general public. He advocates cautious, careful consideration in all matters, and frowns on impulsiveness, believing that it leads to the encouragement of primitive needs. Abadar discourages dependence on government or any religious institution, believing that wealth and happiness should be achievable by anyone with keen judgement, discipline, and a healthy respect for all sensible, just laws.<ref name="ISWG-218"/>

== History ==

During the [[Age of Creation]], Abadar was among the original gods who battled the [[Rovagug|Rough Beast]] who sought to destroy Golarion.<ref name="ISWG-216">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|216}}</ref> According to the ''[[Windsong Testaments]]'', after [[Gorum]] and [[Torag]] forged the shell of the [[Dead Vault]], Abadar provided the perfect key and lock for Rovagug's prison, a key so cunningly made that only [[Asmodeus]] could turn it.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Windsong Testaments: Rage of Creation|page=Paizo Blog|author=[[James Jacobs]]|date=January 2, 2020|url=https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh26}}</ref>

Abadar is credited with guiding the advancement of [[humanoid]] races towards the point where they could establish civilized societies of their own.<ref name="PF8p64"/>

== Home ==

Abadar's divine realm is [[Aktun]], the central and largest district in the city of [[Axis]], and ensures that the district is friendly to [[mortality|mortal]] architects, who can safely travel there to seek inspiration. He does not claim the entire city, but his aeons-long association with Axis and his role as god of cities have turned him into the closest thing to the Eternal City's ruler. Abadar has long served as the guardian and protector of the [[First Vault]], his personal palace and a repository said to be crafted by his own hand that contains perfect versions of everything ever created or seen by civilized peoples.<ref name="PF8p64"/><ref name="G&Mp2">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|174â€“176}}</ref>

== Appearance ==

[[File:Abadar 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of Abadar.]]

Abadar is often described as a clean, refined and cultured [[Taldan (human ethnicity)|Taldan]] [[human]], with dark hair and wearing a golden breastplate. Dressed in an embroidered cloak and fine clothes, Abadar is often depicted possessing a number of keys.<ref name="PF8p64"/><ref name="CSp160"/><ref name="ISWG-218">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|218}}</ref> 
[[Human]]s, [[dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s depict Abadar with a beard, whereas [[elves]] show him beardless, with braids tied in gold thread.<ref name="ISG-14">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Gods|14}}</ref>
In a common myth, Abadar assumes the form of a two-headed (to represent his balanced viewpoint) [[eagle]] for a single day each year and grants favor to those faithful that recognize him as he soars overhead.<ref name="PF8p64"/>

In Tian Xia, Abadar is generally portrayed in painting and sculpture as a good-looking and handsome [[Tian-Shu]] man who wields a golden [[crossbow]] and is dressed in golden robes which are muddy on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book/Dragon Empires Gazetteer|58&ndash;59}}</ref>

== Relationships ==

Abadar strives to maintain agreeable relationships with the other deities, recognizing their influence is conducive to the further advancement of civilized life. In particular, he cultivates strong alliances with [[Iomedae]], [[Irori]], [[Shelyn]], [[Asmodeus]], and [[Erastil]], though differences in opinion often result in conflicts between Abadar and Old Deadeye.<ref name="CSp162">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|162}}</ref> [[Gozreh]] often opposes Abadar's actions, though the Judge of the Gods only recognizes [[Rovagug]] and [[Lamashtu]] as true enemies. Abadar is sometimes seen as a paternal authority figure, especially to others possessing origins in [[Taldor]].<ref name="PF8p64"/><ref name="CSp160">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|160}}</ref> Because he is the patron god of merchants, Abadar is often associated with the [[philosophy]] known as the [[Prophecies of Kalistrade]].<ref name="ISWG-237">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|237}}</ref> The god [[Aroden]] respected Abadar and consulted Abadar's ''The Manual of City-Building'' to aid in his establishment of the country of [[Taldor]] and of the city-state of [[Absalom]].<ref>{{Cite book/A Song of Silver|73}}</ref> Abadar once opened channels to the [[archdevil]] [[Mephistopheles]] to cement an alliance based on the archdevil's interest in contracts but these negotiations failed.<ref>{{Cite book/Breaking the Bones of Hell|75}}</ref>

In the [[Age of Legend]], Abadar's faithful often followed those of [[Elion]], establishing trade posts and settlements in habitable places discovered by Elion's worshippers. However, the relationship was sometimes strained, since Elion's followers often disapproved of the Abadarans' harsh methods of colonisation.<ref name="PF123-66">{{Cite book/The Flooded Cathedral|66}}</ref>

== Providence ==

The faithful of Abadar believe that sudden windfalls of financial good fortune are signs of the god's approval, while increases in expenses that lead to poverty are proof of his anger.<ref name="ISWG-218"/>

== Servants ==

Abadar and his faithful hold creatures that symbolize law and perfection in high regard. Of particular favor are eagles, [[hippogriff]]s, [[griffon]]s,<ref name="PF8p64"/> and his [[divine servitor]]s, the [[horse|horse-like]] [[orsheval]]s.<ref name="ISG-277">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Gods|277}}</ref> On the plane of Axis (and sometimes beyond), he is also served by races that share his [[alignment|philosophy]], including [[archon]]s, [[axiomite]]s, and [[inevitable]]s.<ref name="ISG-275">{{cite book/Inner Sea Gods|275}}</ref>

=== Unique servants ===

; [[Cobblehoof]] 
: This highly intelligent [[celestial]] hippogriff usually appears in full [[barding]], ready to bear a rider into battle.<ref name="PF8p64"/>

; [[Ghost of Malthus|The Ghost of Malthus]] 
: Believed to have once been a priest of Abadar, this spirit is known to appear as a sign of impending [[disease|plague]] or suffering.<ref name="PF8p64"/>

; [[Lawgiver|The Lawgiver]] 
: Appearing as a massive statue of gold and [[steel]], this construct is the [[herald]] of Abadar. It wields the ''[[Gavel of Abadar]]'' in battle, and arrives in order to thwart the spread of [[chaos]]. Alternatively, the Lawgiver has been known to take the form of a two-headed eagle.<ref name="PF8p87">{{Cite book/Seven Days to the Grave|87}}</ref>

== Church of Abadar ==
[[File:Balanced scale of Abadar.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A [[balanced scale of Abadar]], a [[Katapesh]]i adherent of the god.]]

Abadar was worshiped by the ancient [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] before [[Earthfall]], who focused more on his aspects as a god of cities and [[gold]], rather than of law.<ref>{{Cite book/City of Seven Spears|47}}</ref> As the Azlanti built their first towns and sought others to trade with, he saw his cult spread and taught them to establish cities and seek more wealth. When the Azlanti became an empire, Abadar's faith became popular among merchants and politicians.<ref name="PF123-66"/>

Abadar's church turned economy and finances into an academic school. Many temples served as vaults where the church's and the empire's wealth resided, and the government provided significant military and security support to the church. As the empire expanded, Abadar's church founded hundreds of cities and established trade across all colonies, and turned the formation of a stable economy and a network of merchants who could carry goods and [[currency]] across the entire empire into an art.<ref name="PF123-66"/>

The temples of Abadar are designed to function independently of one another, usually serving a single community or region. The individual clergy are usually aligned with the local government, but are forbidden to fight amongst themselves and often stand as a neutral faction during legitimate conflicts. Worship of the Master of the First Vault in the [[Inner Sea region]] is commonplace in the nations of [[Absalom]], [[Andoran]], [[Brevoy]], [[Cheliax]], [[Druma]], [[Katapesh]], the [[Mana Wastes]], [[Molthune]], [[Nex]], [[Osirion]], [[Sargava]], [[Taldor]], and [[Varisia]],<ref name="PF8p64"/><ref name="CSp160"/><ref name="ISG-12"/><ref name="ISWG-62">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|62}}</ref> and among [[Chelaxian (human ethnicity)|Chelaxians]], dwarves, halflings, [[Keleshite (human ethnicity)|Keleshites]], Taldans, [[Tian (human ethnicity)|Tian]], and [[Varisian]]s in all parts of the [[Inner Sea region]].<ref name="ISWG-13">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|13}}</ref><ref name="ISWG-15">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|15}}</ref><ref name="ISWG-19">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|19}}</ref><ref name="ISWG-20">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|20}}</ref><ref name="ISWG-22">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|22}}</ref><ref name="ISWG-24">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|24}}</ref>

=== Worshipers ===

Abadar is primarily worshiped by judges, merchants, lawyers, and aristocrats, though many others turn to the worship of the Master of the First Vault in the hope of attaining wealth and happiness.<ref name="PF8p64"/> He is also an object of veneration by the poor, or those who have suffered at the hands of others. These latter groups pray that their suffering is alleviated, and that justice is restored to them.<ref name="ISWG-218"/> Abadar's faithful believe structures represent the protection provided by society and always hold formal ceremonies indoors.  Regular services are generally held in the morning and often involve [[song]]s which require the congregation to harmonize, which may symbolize the community working together. Lay worshipers will maintain the appearance of prosperity in manner and dress and, even in periods of hardship, a tidy appearance.<ref name="ISG-15-7">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Gods|15&ndash;17}}</ref>

==== Obedience ====

Certain dedicated worshipers of Abadar perform daily [[obedience]]s in order to receive [[divine magic|divine]] blessings known as a [[boon]]s from their god. Abadar's obedience is a ritual in which the worshiper places a collection of keys, [[gem]]s, and coins on a scale, and moves them back and forth until both sides are balanced, all the while meditating on passages from ''[[The Order of Numbers]]'', one of Abadar's holy texts.<ref name="ISG-12">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Gods|12}}</ref>

==== Non-human worshipers ====
Abadar's association with cities and trade means he is worshipped by many [[halfling]]s, who tend to congregate in Golarion's larger settlements.<ref>{{Cite book/Halflings of Golarion|17}}</ref> Abadar is also venerated by [[dwarves|dwarven]] [[engineer]]s and [[architecture|architects]].<ref>{{Cite book/Dwarves of Golarion|6}}</ref>

==== Worship in Tian Xia ====
Abadar is also a popular deity on the continent of [[Tian Xia]] on the other side of Golarion from the Inner Sea region. There he is known as the god of walls and ditches, and closely associated with the building of earthworks, both for defense and the expansion of land. A temple of Abadar exists in almost every major city on the continent, and the independent city of [[Goka]] is said to contain the greatest church in all the [[Dragon Empires]], if not the entire world.<ref>{{Cite book/Dragon Empires Gazetteer|58&ndash;59}}</ref>

=== Clergy ===
The clergy of Abadar is primarily composed of [[cleric]]s, but [[inquisitor]]s and occasionally [[paladin]]s are called into his service as well.  Clerics and paladins of Abadar are granted special favor with the preparation of the spell ''[[word of recall]]'', provided it is used to return them to the designated sanctuary of the temple of their home city.<ref name="PF8p64"/><ref name="G&Mp5">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|5}}</ref> 

[[Knight]]s of Abadar fight against corruption and anarchy. They understand both the letter and spirit of the law. They often serve as judges in places where the application of law is starting to dissolve.<ref>{{Cite book/Knights of the Inner Sea|18}}</ref>

Clerical orders include [[Taxmasters]], [[Justiciar]]s, and the [[Balanced scale of Abadar|Balanced Scales]], primarily based in [[Katapesh]]. Taxmasters are  primarily inquisitors and include both the less intimidating, desk-bound investigators and the enforcers in the field, which may be charged to mete out justice directly.<ref name="ISG-14-6">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Gods|14&ndash;16}}</ref>
Justiciars are a prestigious order of devout clergy, dedicated to spreading their deity's ideals of civilization and order,  at the point of a [[crossbow]] [[bolt]], if necessary.<ref name="PF8p64"/> [[Balanced scale of Abadar|Balanced Scales of Katapesh]] fill a unique role searching out hidden, misplaced or ill-gotten wealth for the benefit of the church and in return gain access to the First Vault<ref>{{Cite book/Dark Markets|54&ndash;55}}</ref> 

The clergy structure their orders like mercantile houses, with Bankers and Archbankers responsible for territories of increasing size with each church counting each [[currency|coin]] in its vault as a blessing unto itself. 

The priesthood sees their role as responsible for encouraging civilization, trade, and law by promoting co-operation and fairness and by providing loans and other banking services.  They encourage thrift and neighborly behavior as a means to enhance each individual's self-interest.  Their own service to the community may include ''pro-bono'' legal services but they do not donate [[medicine|healing services]]&mdash;except those that help overall community and public health.

Knowledge of the law and community news are important areas of concern and part of the daily routine to the priesthood. Younger members are expected to carry news and administer justice, typically carrying a golden bolt to compensate the family of any criminal executed.<ref name="ISG-14-6"/>

The clergy never give money, regardless of the need, but will instead loan the required funds at a reasonable rate, recording the details in the books and records of the church.  Conversely they themselves are expected to tithe to the church and often ensure the funds are available to tithe from income generated by their direct investments in the local community.

Most Abadaran priests attired for formal services dress in robes of white [[silk]] trimmed with golden thread with a belt or necklace of gold holding a single, golden key. They also often wear half-cloaks of deep yellow or golden color.<ref name="ISWG-218"/>

=== Temples and shrines === 
Temples dedicated to Abadar are usually large, elaborately decorated buildings designed for multiple functions; in addition to being centers of worship, they often provide the surrounding community with banking and other services. Such sites are often built near courthouses, and led by a Banker or Archbanker.<ref name="PF8p64"/> Most temples contain elaborate stained glass windows of predominantly yellow color that bathe the interior with a soft, golden light. These windows are generally high and narrow to discourage thieves.<ref name="ISWG-218"/>

=== Holy texts ===
With the clergy of Abadar often serving their communities as clerks, a given temple is likely to have extensive records within its vaults.<ref name="PF8p64"/> Among these many documents, the following texts have primary importance among the god of cities' faithful.

; ''[[The Order of Numbers]]''
: Usually bearing elaborate decoration, writing, and binding, this book serves as the core text of the Church of Abadar.<ref name="PF8p64"/>

; ''[[The Manual of City-Building]]''
: Often stored prominently in a place of honor, this text contains advice on the topic of founding and running a community.<ref name="PF8p64"/>

=== Holidays ===
The first month of the year, [[Abadius]], is named in honor of the Master of the First Vault,<ref name="ISWG-248">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|248}}</ref> and in conjunction with spreading Abadar's ideals, the Church celebrates festivals associated with his goals.<ref name="PF8p64"/>

; [[Market's Door]] 
: This day, which varies from year to year, marks the arrival of the first shipment of goods from the fall harvest.<ref name="PF8p64"/>

; [[Taxfest]] 
: After taxes have been collected, the clergy of Abadar celebrates with a feast open to the community and its leaders.<ref name="PF8p64"/>

=== Favored animals ===

Gods are often associated with certain [[animal]]s, either because they possess a quality that the god favors, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to it. Abadar's favored animals include [[monkey]]s, [[eagle|golden eagle]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[dog|watchdogs]] and [[cat|house cats]], mounts, and beasts of burden.<ref name="AA-ibc">{{Cite book/Animal Archive|inside back cover}}</ref>

== Organizations ==

The following organizations are not part of the official church of Abadar, but are nevertheless associated with the Judge of the Gods.
