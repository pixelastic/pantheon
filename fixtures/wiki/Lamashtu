'''Lamashtu''' (pronounced lah-MAHSH-too)<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|247}}</ref> is the mother and patroness of many misshapen and malformed creatures that crawl, slither, or flap on, above, or below the surface of [[Golarion]].<ref name="G&Mp24">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|24}}</ref><ref name="PF5p66">{{Cite book/Sins of the Saviors|66}}</ref> Her unholy symbol is a three-eyed [[jackal]] head, which may be represented in many ways, and her sacred animal is the jackal.<ref name="DEG-61">{{Cite book/Dragon Empires Gazetteer|61}}</ref>

== History ==

[[File:Lamashtu.png|250px|right|thumb|The demonic rune of Lamashtu.]]

Lamashtu was once a mighty [[demon lord]] who became the first such entity to achieve true [[god]]hood. In ages past, she was the lover of [[Pazuzu]]. What is known for certain is that she lured the god [[Curchanus]] into her territory and beset him with swarms of demons and other monsters until he was weak enough for her to attack. By defeating him, she ripped his godly domain over beasts from him, beginning an ancient vendetta with Curchanus' protégée, [[Desna]]. This imbued the demoness with a small amount of his divine power.<ref name="PF5p69">{{Cite book/Sins of the Saviors|69}}</ref>

Pazuzu was enraged by this shift in power, and as Lamashtu returned from that battle he betrayed and attacked her. He wounded her terribly, but her new-found divinity allowed her to survive; they have been dire enemies ever since. Lamashtu's vendetta against him is only equaled by Desna's own vendetta against her.<ref name="PF5p69"/>

When she learnt that demons were the result of experimentation by a [[Four Horsemen|Horseman of the Apocalypse]], Lamashtu invaded [[Abaddon]] and killed the Horsemen [[Drulaema]] and [[Roshmolem]]. From torturing Roshmolem, Lamashtu learned the "art" of creating demons.<ref>{{Cite book/Book of the Damned|282}}</ref> Once she coupled that knowledge with the use of her own body to gestate the demons, she birthed the [[vavakia]], a true masterpiece of the art of creating demons.<ref>{{Cite book/Lords of Chaos|61}}</ref>

It is claimed by many [[monstrous humanoid]] races that she was their first progenitor and creator.<ref name="PF5p69"/>

== Home ==

Lamashtu's realm is [[Kurnugia]], the largest layer of the [[Abyss]].<ref name="LoC6"/>

== Appearance ==

Pictures of Lamashtu portray her as a jackal-headed woman, with a third vertical eye in the center of her forehead, heavily pregnant, with feathered wings (like a [[raven|raven's]]), a [[snake|snake's]] tail, and taloned feet like a [[vulture|vulture's]]). She is often depicted carrying her two deadly blades, [[Redlust and Chillheart]]: the former is of fire, the latter of ice. The blades may grow and shrink from the size of a [[falchion]] to that of a [[kukri]]. Her head may vary depending on the nature of her worshipers: [[gnoll]]s preferring the jackal head, [[medusa]]s a snake's, [[harpy|harpies]] a [[Hawk|hawk's]], and so on.<ref name="LoC6">{{Cite book/Lords of Chaos|6}}</ref> She is often depicted surrounded by countless adherents, with a single individual rising above the rest.<ref name="ISWG-223"/>

== Relationships ==

Lamashtu, in a stance befitting her demonic origins, considers all other gods her enemies. Despite this widespread animosity, she focuses her attentions on growing her cults and expanding their reach, as well as the birthing of new and hideous monstrosities.<ref name="LoC6"/><ref name="PF5-6970">{{Cite book/Sins of the Saviors|69|69&ndash;70}}</ref>

=== Non-evil deities ===

She is aware of Desna's hatred of her due to the murder of Curchanus, but treats her as beneath notice.<ref name="LoC6"/> She has an odd view of [[Shelyn]], whom Lamashtu would love to capture and twist into her own monstrous vision of beauty. Needless to say, the faithful of Shelyn find this an abhorrent and terrifying concept.<ref name="PF5-6970"/>

[[Aroden]] and his clergy view Lamashtu as a dire symbol of the wilderness and dangers lying beyond the boundaries of civilization.<ref>{{Cite book/A Song of Silver|73}}</ref>

=== Pazuzu ===

[[Urgathoa]] and [[Rovagug]] are, with Pazuzu, her greatest enemies. The Lamashtan&ndash;Pazuzu war is old and bitter: Lamashtu is the more powerful, Pazuzu the more focused on the campaign. The war is often fought by minions of the two demon lords but can escalate, causing much collateral damage, but neither side has gained a significant advantage yet over the other.<ref name="LoC6"/> Lamashtu believes that her status as a full deity means that she has little to fear from Pazuzu, but she would do well to remember her own murder of Curchanus when she was still a [[demigod]]dess.<ref>{{Cite book/Book of the Damned|87}}</ref> Pazuzu's name is believed to disperse Lamashtu's influence, and amulets with his name or image are worn by pregnant women and newborns to ward her corruption away.<ref>{{Cite book/Inner Sea Gods|98}}</ref>

Before they became bitter enemies, Pazuzu and Lamashtu were lovers during the [[Age of Creation]]. One of their trysts in what would become the [[Lost Coast]] region of [[Varisia]] gave birth to a son named [[Uvaglor]], among other spawn. Their cults rebuff this story out of a terrible shame, and have been playing out their patrons' battle in a small way.<ref>{{Cite book/Pathfinder 6|23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast|88}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Demons Revisited|63}}</ref>

=== Other demon lords ===

Lamashtu is not actively at war with other demon lords, and does not seek to conquer the Abyss. She does have rivalries with some of them, and is said to have others as her lovers. The latter group includes [[Socothbenoth]], who claims to have sired children with her.<ref name="ISWG-223"/> [[Nocticula]] makes her opposition to Lamashtu clear and, in return, Lamashtu is well aware of Nocticula's murderous ascent to power.<ref name="LoC6"/>

[[Baphomet]], the first [[minotaur]], began his [[fiend]]ish life as a consort hand-crafted by Lamashtu until his foolhardy attempt to curry favour with her by stealing Asmodeus' sceptre ended up with his capture. After Baphomet escaped from Asmodeus' clutches and established himself as a demon lord in his own right, he reconciled with Lamashtu, and the two are allies and occasionally consorts, though he is no longer her servant.<ref name="PF5-6970"/><ref>{{Cite book/Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth|71}}</ref>

=== Hell ===

The [[goblin hero-gods]] used to be servants of [[Asmodeus]] until Lamashtu stole them from [[Hell]] and adopted them as her own children. When she brought them to the Abyss, she carved out their new realm of [[Basalfeyst]] by drawing a corner of Hell across the [[Maelstrom]]. The four [[hero-god]]s are now free to act but remain loyal to Lamashtu.<ref name="LoC7">{{Cite book/Lords of Chaos|7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|204}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Assault on Longshadow|73}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Book of the Damned|158}}</ref>

Lamashtu once had a tryst with the [[archdevil]] [[Typhon]]. This may have led to Typhon's destruction, as it displeased [[Asmodeus]].<ref>{{Cite book/Kobold Quarterly 22|10}}</ref>

=== Abaddon ===

Lamashtu bears a grudge against [[Szuriel]] for turning back her invasion of Abaddon, and wishes to use Szuriel's body to birth hideous offspring.<ref>{{Cite book/Rasputin Must Die!|74}}</ref> Szuriel herself is grateful that Lamashtu's murder of Roshmolem set in motion her own rise to power as Horseman of War.<ref>{{Cite book/Book of the Damned|97}}</ref>

== Providence ==

Lamashtu's favor manifests as violent dreams, the appearance of sudden deformities, or unexplained pregnancies that often result in the painful (and sometimes fatal) birth of a deformed child. Worshipers who displease her may give birth to a "perfect" child, such as a [[human]] or [[halfling]], nightmares, or welts. They may also find themselves infertile or unable to achieve sexual satisfaction.<ref name="CS165"/><ref name="ISWG-223"/>

== Servants ==

[[File:Yaenit.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Yaenit]].]]

Lamashtu and her deranged faithful hold creatures of deformity, monstrosity, and virility in high regard. [[Thaumaturge]]s and [[cleric]]s in her service often call [[shemhazian]] demons and other Abyssal creatures into their service.<ref name="PF5p73">{{Cite book/Sins of the Saviors|73}}</ref> Her [[divine servitor]] race are the [[swaithe]] demons, foul creatures that incite [[animal]]s to attack civilized society.<ref name="ISG-297">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Gods|297}}</ref>

A [[Kurnugian jackal]] is a [[jackal]] granted gifts of intelligence and [[psychic magic|psychic]] powers by Lamashtu. Its name is derived from Kurnugia, Lamashtu's Abyssal realm.<ref name="TiO-61">{{Cite book/Troubles in Otari|61}}</ref>

=== Unique servants ===

; [[Bloodmaw]]
: This hideous yet powerful and cunning [[yeth hound]] has one green eye and one red. He relishes the promise of carnage and a good hunt.<ref name="PF5p73"/>

; [[Yaenit]]
: These slavering, monstrous hyena-demons resemble corrupted [[hound archon]]s with gangly limbs and deformed [[hyena]] heads. They love maiming and killing in Lamashtu's name.<ref name="PF5p73"/>

; [[Yethazmari|The Yethazmari]]
: Appearing as an enormous jackal, standing 14 foot tall at the shoulder with smoking eye sockets, black leathery wings and a snake for a tail, the [[herald]] of Lamashtu brings terror and bloodshed. In its wake, the spawn of horrific and brutal trysts rise up to cause [[disease|madness]] anew.<ref name="PF5p73"/><ref name="LoC6"/>

; [[Seven Witches]]
: The Seven Witches serve Lamashtu in the Abyss. They are her favourite daughters: powerful [[demon]]ic [[Sorcerer|sorceresses]].<ref name="LoC6"/>

== Church of Lamashtu ==

[[File:Lamashtan holy symbol.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|A Lamashtan unholy symbol.]]

Lamashtu's church is scattered and lacks an overall hierarchy, yet it is rare for two priest's to come into direct conflict, as they recognize each other's shared devotion and the hostility visited by those outside the religion. Many [[demoniac]]s pay obeisances to Lamashtu as she is a demon lord as well as a goddess.<ref>{{Cite book/Sins of the Saviors|67|67&ndash;69}}</ref> Her followers can most frequently be found in the [[Hold of Belkzen]], [[Irrisen]], [[Katapesh]], the [[Mwangi Expanse]], [[Nex]], [[Osirion]], the [[River Kingdoms]], Varisia, and the [[Worldwound]],<ref name="ISWG-223">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|223}}</ref><ref name="ISWG-126">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|126}}</ref> and among [[Ulfen]]<ref name="ISWG-21">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|21}}</ref> and [[half-orc]]s throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].<ref name="ISWG-29">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|29}}</ref>

Lamashtu is also worshiped on the continent of [[Tian Xia]] were she is known as '''Grandmother Nightmare'''. Although her devotees can be found in most major cities there, she is most commonly (and openly) venerated in the wilder parts of the [[Darklands of Tian Xia|Darklands]], [[Goka]], [[Nagajor]], [[Shaguang]], the [[Valashmai Jungle]], the [[Wall of Heaven]] mountains, and [[Wanshou]].<ref name="DEG-61"/>

=== Worshipers ===

Lamashtu's followers seek out deformity in themselves and in others, and perform scarring and mutilation on themselves and others. They detest traditional forms of beauty and seek to destroy or kill it whenever possible. Some intentionally make themselves more beast-like, with her non-human followers do the opposite to better blend in with the more civilized races.<ref name="ISWG-223"/> She is typically worshiped by races such as gnolls (who claim they were created when Lamashtu took a hyena as her consort),<ref name="LoC6"/> [[goblin]]s, and [[medusa]]e.<ref name="CS165">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|165}}</ref> Lamashtu is considered the creator goddess of many monster races who worship her accordingly, including [[lamia]]s and [[morlock]]s.<ref name="LoC6"/>

Some sects, including the one in the city of [[Katapesh (city)|Katapesh]], have developed the means to supernaturally impregnate humanoids, both men and women, with children of Lamashtu. Such births cause severe damage to the host. The monstrous babies may require care in a specialized nursery. This includes submergence in a mixture of blood, afterbirth, and the [[waters of Lamashtu]].<ref>{{Cite book/Broken Chains|23&ndash;24}}</ref>

=== Clergy ===

Her [[human]] priests generally wear a jackal mask (of leather or metal), a pair of [[sword]]s or [[knife|knives]] made to resemble Lamashtu's personal [[weapon]]s, and a cloak of black feathers. Monstrous races wear much the same but typically forgo the mask.<ref name="CS165"/>

=== Temples & shrines===

[[File:Lamashtu_Priest.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A devotee of the Mother of Beasts.]]

Lamashtu is not usually worshiped in a constructed building, but rather a ring of stones, pillars, trees, wooden blocks, a pit in the ground, or a flat rock. Entrances into underground places of worship represent the entrance to the goddess' underworld domain. They typically are found on the outskirts of civilization, or in the true wilderness, and many are stained with blood and littered with the remains of failed births, and the victims of the successful ones.<ref name="PF5-67">{{Cite book/Sins of the Saviors|67}}</ref><ref name="LoC6"/>

=== Unholy Texts ===

Lamashtu's cults rarely place much interest or emphasis on texts, preferring to rely on divine revelation and madness.  Nonetheless, the more coherent of her followers have jotted down some horrendous writings over the eons.{{fact}}

; [[Skull of Mashaag|''The Skull of Mashaag'']]
: The yellowed skull of a [[yaenit]] who died in the service of Lamashtu, this object has the ability to speak the goddess' will in several languages. Every few years, her worshipers meet to hear its teachings, and heroes from each tribe undergo a series of contests to determine which group is to keep it next.<ref name="PF5p73"/>

; [[Four Hides of Lawm|''The Four Hides of Lawm'']]
: This is a collection of three leather straps, each made from the skin of a humanoid.  The fourth was lost long ago and is said to contain monstrous rites of power and fertility in Lamashtu's name.<ref name="PF5p73"/>

=== Holidays ===

The cults of Lamashtu celebrate no known regular holidays; though births, deformities, and demonic visitations are often the cause of hedonistic and debauched celebrations among them.{{Source}} Strangely, the autumnal month of [[Lamashan]] is named after the Mother of Monsters.<ref name="ISWG-248">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|248}}</ref>

=== Favored animals ===

Gods are often associated with certain [[animal]]s, either because they possess a quality favored by the god, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to them. Lamashtu's favored animals include [[jackal]]s, [[hyena]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], and deformed or hybrid animals.<ref name="AA-ibc">{{Cite book/Animal Archive|inside back cover}}</ref>
