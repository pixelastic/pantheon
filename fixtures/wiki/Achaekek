'''Achaekek''' (pronounced uh-CHAY-kek)<ref name="CS-246">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|246}}</ref> is the [[god]] of [[assassin]]s, and the patron god of the [[Red Mantis|Red Mantis assassins]] based on the island of [[Mediogalti Island|Mediogalti]].<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|196}}</ref> Achaekek takes a middle position between [[Calistria]], the goddess of revenge if not necessarily murder, and [[Norgorber]] who is the god of all murder, whether paid for or not.<ref name="G&M-45">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|45}}</ref> His symbol is a pair of [[mantis]] claws depicted as if in prayer.<ref name="CS-170">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|170}}</ref>

== History ==

[[File:Achaekek.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Achaekek, the [[Mantis]] God.]]

Achaekek's status as a deity is sometimes debated, but many theologians agree that he was the first entity created by the gods to carry out their will. There is general disagreement as to who exactly is responsible for Achaekek's creation, although it was most likely an alliance of several deities<ref name="PF9-81">{{Cite book/Escape from Old Korvosa|81}}</ref>&mdash;or perhaps, as his own church suggests, Achaekek's creator might have been a deity long ago murdered by Achaekek himself.<ref name="ISF-6">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Faiths|6}}</ref> According to the ''[[Windsong Testaments]]'', Achaekek was one of the first eight deities of this incarnation of [[Great Beyond|creation]], and originated as a [[lawful neutral]] judge over [[good]] and [[evil]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Windsong Testaments: The Three Fears of Pharasma|page=Paizo Blog|author=[[James Jacobs]]|date=October 31, 2019|url=https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgzu}}</ref> When the first deities turned their attention toward the [[Material Plane]], Achaekek stood sentinel at the edge of [[Pharasma's Spire]] to oversee the creation of life. Near the end of the [[Age of Creation]], when [[Rovagug]] was rampaging across creation, Achaekek consumed his own impartiality and descended into savagery, becoming a mindless beast.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Windsong Testaments: Rage of Creation|page=Paizo Blog|author=[[James Jacobs]]|date=January 2, 2020|url=https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh26}}</ref>

In the [[Age of Legend]], before he became a patron of assassins, Achaekek was worshipped by the ancient [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] as a god of monsters and natural disasters. In the wake of Earthfall, some of his deluded priests claimed that he was responsible. At some point after that, Achaekek's faith spread to Mediogalti Island, where his new devotees worshipped him with murder and blood.<ref name="PF123-67">{{Cite book/The Flooded Cathedral|67}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/City of Seven Spears|47}}</ref>

Whatever his true origins may be, Achaekek was created as an agent for the gods, an enforcer of divine justice, specifically targeting all mortals who hoped to usurp the power of a god and achieve divinity. Not wishing to be become targets of He Who Walks in Blood themselves, however, they made him incapable of killing those who truly were gods, restricting his powers to slay those of demigod status or below.<ref name="PF9-81"/><ref name="ISF-6"/>

The Mantis God has thwarted those seeking divinity numerous times throughout recorded history. The most famous instances include the slaying of [[Marsis]] during the [[Age of Enthronement]], and the slaying of [[Yazanova]] in the [[Tusk Mountains]] in [[-212 AR]].<ref name="PF9-81"/>

== Relationships ==

The Mantis God has at most an uneasy relationship with [[Golarion|Golarion's]] deities, as most do not approve of his heavy-handed purpose and methods. None dare to oppose him however, at least not openly,<ref name="CS-170"/> and Achaekek keeps no relations of his own with other deities. This extends to his own younger sister, [[Grandmother Spider]], who often tries to convince him to rebel against other gods, although he is known to be extremely displeased with his followers if they kill Grandmother Spider's adherents.<ref name="ISF-9"/><ref name="PA-179">{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|179}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Faiths of Golarion|15}}</ref> No deity admits to ordering him to assassinate someone,<ref name="PF9-81"/> though there are few doubts that many of the gods have requested his services.<ref name="ISF-9"/> Achaekek seems to instinctively find his targets, although some believe that the orders come from some yet-unknown source.<ref name="PF9-81"/>

== Church of Achaekek ==

[[File:Cleric of Achaekek.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A [[cleric]] of Achaekek.]]

Achaekek does not actively seek followers. He is mentioned rarely in religious texts, but does appear in the ancient ''[[Book of Maan]]'' and the ''[[Path of Ways]]'' as a slayer of gods, something his church claims Achaekek is not currently capable of doing.<ref name="PF9-67">{{Cite book/Escape from Old Korvosa|67}}</ref><ref name="ISF-8">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Faiths|8}}</ref> [[Cleric]]s of Achaekek are themselves assassins, even if they lack skill, and those who live on Mediogalti Island are expected to provide some service to improve the city of [[Ilizmagorti]].<ref name="ISF-7">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Faiths|7}}</ref>

He is occasionally worshiped by some ruthless [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s who wish to emulate his efficiency in killing.<ref name="G&M-45"/><ref name="ISF-6"/> Druids of Achaekek focus on [[vermin]], often have a [[giant mantis]] as their [[animal companion]], and are not considered part of the organized church; they forsake all links to friends or family in order to draw themselves as close to Achaekek as possible. As outsiders, they often serve as investigators or even assassins of traitors to the faith.<ref name="ISF-6"/>

The largest public temple to the Mantis God is the [[Pagoda of the Mantis]] in the [[Redshore]] neighborhood of the city of Ilizmagorti,<ref name="CoG-31">{{Cite book/Cities of Golarion|31}}</ref> although the center of the faith is the heavily guarded [[Sarzari Library]] located within the [[Crimson Citadel]], the headquarters of the infamous Red Mantis assassins located deep in Mediogalti Isle's jungles.<ref name="FG-40">{{Cite book/Faction Guide|40}}</ref><ref name="ISF-7"/>

In ancient Azlant, Achaekek's priests revered dangerous [[animal]]s and [[beast]]s, and would often sacrifice enemies of the faith by throwing them into [[crocodile]] pits or leaving them in the forest for [[cat]]s and [[bear]]s to eat. They revelled in earthquakes and tsunamis, and often claimed that Achaekek was responsible in the wake of the calamity. Nearly all other Azlanti considered them dangerous and savage, and both the empire and enemy faiths regularly hunted them down. Most of his temples were located in remote areas, with a few hidden and kept secret in cities.<ref name="PF123-67"/>

=== Relations with other religions ===

Achaekek's followers have no tolerance for the [[Skinsaw Cult]] sect of [[Norgorber]], but allow other worshipers of the god of secrets into Ilizmagorti. They respect [[Mephistopheles]] and his domain over contracts, and followers of [[Nocticula]] as peers in assassination (though not as much for acting as lone agents).<ref name="ISF-9"/>

They avoid initiating hostilities with other religions over doctrine but are staunchly opposed to [[Rahadoum]], the cult's ancient home, which exiled them after enacting the [[Laws of Mortality]].<ref name="ISF-9"/>

=== Red Mantis Assassins ===

[[File:Achaekek and Red Mantis assassins.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Achaekek is worshipped by Red Mantis assassins.]]

{{Main|Red Mantis}}

The Red Mantis assassins secretly venerate He Who Walks in Blood. They use the Mantis God's persona and tactics as a model for their behavior and organization.<ref name="CS-170"/> The Red Mantis seek to emulate their patron's role by never targeting a rightful monarch, just as Achaekek is incapable of killing the truly divine. They see the murder of monarchs as blasphemous and abhorrent, and consider them the anointed agents of the gods in the mortal world.<ref name="PF9-67"/><ref name="ISF-6"/>

Leading the Red Mantis are the [[Vernai]], also known as the "High Killers", from the Crimson Citadel. These 13 women are themselves led by the [[Blood Mistress]], a figure considered to represent the Mantis God's will on Golarion.<ref name="ISF-6"/>

=== Heretics ===

Some of Achaekek's worshipers disavow the Red Mantis assassins but still receive [[divine magic]] from the Mantis God, though these heretics are considered enemies of the church by the Vernai. While this sometimes leads to comparisons to [[Skinsaw Cult|Skinsaw cultists]], both groups despise even the insinuation of such a connection.<ref name="ISF-8"/>

== Realm ==

An opening to Achaekek's realm of [[Blood Vale]] is carved into the base of [[Pharasma's Spire]] in the [[Boneyard]]. The Vale's caverns, which run adjacent to [[Hell]], [[Abaddon]], and the [[Abyss]], are full of crimson jungles.<ref name="PA-179"/><ref name="ISF-9">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Faiths|9}}</ref> The plane's razor-edged walls include passages to those adjacent planes, and the Mantis God keeps dens on other planes, including [[Avernus]] in [[Hell]].<ref name="ISF-9"/>{{Conflict|Realm}}

=== Planar allies ===

[[Zyrruthys]] is a huge intelligent mantis that enjoys destroying villages of blasphemers and is Achaekek's [[herald]]. Often confused with Achaekek, Zyrruthys never asks for payment when summoned to perform this task.<ref name="ISF-9"/>

== Artifacts ==

The ''[[Mantis Blade]]'' is a unique [[minor artifact]] sacred to followers of Achaekek.<ref>{{Cite book/Artifacts & Legends|60}}</ref>

== References ==

[[Paizo]] published a major article on Achaekek in ''[[Inner Sea Faiths]]''.
