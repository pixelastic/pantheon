It is not surprising that the [[Tian Xia]] [[goddess]] '''Daikitsu''' is a common object of veneration given that she has the everyday subjects of rice, agriculture, and craftsmanship under her divine purview.<ref name="DEG-59">{{Cite book/Dragon Empires Gazetteer|59}}</ref> 

== Appearance ==

Daikitsu appears as a beautiful [[kitsune]] woman with snow-white fur and nine tails.<ref name="DEG-59"/> 

== Holy symbol ==

Daikitsu's [[holy symbol]] is that of a nine-tailed [[fox]].<ref name="DEG-59"/>

== Relationships ==

[[Nalinivati]], the patron goddess of [[naga]]s and the [[snake]]-like [[humanoid]]s known as the [[nagaji]], has been romantically linked with the Daikitsu, although both deities deny this claim.<ref>{{Cite book/Red Harvest|5}}</ref>

== Church of Daikitsu ==

Daikitsu is widely venerated across Tian Xia as her role as a goddess of rice and agriculture ensures many seek her favour. Farmers seek her blessing to ensure fertile fields and good harvests; smiths and craftsmen worship her aspect as a patron of artifice; and families pray to her for safety. Daikitsu is also worshipped as the patron of the kitsune people and has many followers amongst them.<ref name="DEG-59"/> 

While worshipped across Tian Xia, Daikitsu's largest centres of worship are: within the [[Forest of Spirits]], where many kitsune reside; the [[samurai]] nation of [[Minkai]]; and [[Shokuro]] that used to serve as the breadbasket of the former empire of [[Lung Wa]].<ref name="DEG-59"/>
