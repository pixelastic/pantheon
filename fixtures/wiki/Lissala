'''Lissala''' (pronounced lis-SALL-uh)<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|247}}</ref> is the [[goddess]] of [[rune]]s, fate, and the reward of service, and was once a major religious force in the empire of [[Thassilon]].<ref name="ISWG-235">{{cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|235}}</ref> She was depicted either as a stern woman with no mouth,<ref name="PF5-29">{{Cite book/Sins of the Saviors|29}}</ref> or as a creature with a [[snake|snake's]] lower half, a [[human]] woman's upper half, six wings, and a ''[[Sihedron]]'' for a head.<ref>{{cite book/The Godsmouth Heresy|6''f''}}</ref><ref name="GR42"/>

== History ==

Lissala's faith originated on [[Azlant]], where she started off as a [[demigod]]dess whom few people understood.<ref name="PF123-71">{{Cite book/The Flooded Cathedral|71}}</ref>

When Thassilon was founded, its [[Xin|First King Xin]], a follower of Lissala, brought her faith to [[Avistan]] from Azlant, where it saw a renaissance.<ref name="PF123-71"/><ref name="GR42">{{cite book/Giants Revisited|42}}</ref> She taught the [[philosophy]] of the [[seven virtues of rule]], guidelines that promised rewards for both rulers and their subjects if her teachings were strictly followed. These were eventually perverted into the [[seven mortal sins]] by the [[runelords]]; Lissala eventually embraced the [[evil]] [[sin magic]] and became a true [[deity]]. She also outlined the workings of fate to her followers. Lissala also seems to have been, if not the source, then one of the major teachers of the art of [[rune magic]], through which the rulers of Thassilon erected their mighty works and controlled the populace.<ref name="PF123-71"/><ref name="PF1-73">{{Cite book/Burnt Offerings|73}}</ref>

Near the end of Azlant and Thassilon, the Lissalan cults who stayed in Azlant dwindled in number and were regarded as heretics by the Thassilonian cults, who often sent missionaries to purge them. [[Krune]], the final runelord of sloth, was also her final chief priest.<ref name="PF123-71"/><ref name="PF1-76">{{Cite book/Burnt Offerings|76}}</ref> During the reign of the runelords, her religion become more slavish and violent, emphasizing flagellation and mortification of the flesh.<ref name="PF1-78">{{Cite book/Burnt Offerings|78}}</ref>

After [[Earthfall]], which destroyed both Azlant and Thassilon, Lissala's cult was almost wiped out on Golarion. In [[4713 AR]], the Lissalans resurfaced to free their leader Krune, but he only lived long enough to be defeated and killed by agents of the [[Pathfinder Society]].<ref name="PA-174">{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|174}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Secrets of Roderic's Cove|76}}</ref>

== Relationships ==

Lissala was a rival of [[Amaznen]], the other Azlanti god of magic. Their disagreement stemmed from the fact that Amaznen taught that some knowledge should be kept secret, while Lissala believed that knowledge should always be shared.<ref>{{Cite book/The Flooded Cathedral|68}}</ref>

Some Lissalan cults were enticed by the dogma of [[Sicva]] and sometimes worked alongside her followers, as both goddesses recognised the importance of duty and structure.<ref name="PF123-71"/>

== Servants ==

Chief among Lissala's servants is her [[herald]], [[Kurshu the Undying]], whom she created from the parts of many different creatures.<ref>{{cite book/Into the Nightmare Rift|88|88&ndash;89}}</ref>

== Unholy symbols ==

Lissala is known to have two types of [[unholy symbol]]s: her main symbol is a variant ''[[Sihedron]]'' rune (see right); her second type was a [[whip]] twisted into the keyed rune of the particular rune magic practitioner using it.<ref>{{cite book/Into the Nightmare Rift|72}}</ref>

== Church of Lissala ==

Those few followers remaining believe that knowledge can be gained by following a path of self-harm in an attempt to burn knowledge into their minds.<ref>{{cite book/Faiths of Corruption|21}}</ref> [[Rune giant]]s refuse to believe Lissala is dead and continue to worship her.<ref name="GR42"/>

Rumors have been growing that [[cleric]]s of Lissala have been reappearing, and that some of the runes of Thassilon retain some connection to her.<ref name="ISWG-235"/>

=== Temples and shrines ===

Only the ruins of the [[Great Temple of Lissala]] and the smaller temples in fabled [[Xin-Shalast]] in [[Varisia]] and the [[Hold of Belkzen]] remain to indicate the awesome power she once wielded over the hearts and minds of the ancient Thassilonians.<ref name="PF1-79" >{{Cite book/Burnt Offerings|79}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Spires of Xin-Shalast|30}}</ref><ref name="ISWG-235"/>

=== Holidays ===

One of Lissala's high holidays is known as the [[Feast of Sigils]].<ref name="ISWG-235"/>
