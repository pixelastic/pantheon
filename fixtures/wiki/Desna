'''Desna''' (pronounced DEZ-nuh)<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|246}}</ref> was one of the first [[deity|deities]], but while her peers burdened themselves with the task of creating [[Golarion]], she spent her time building the heavens. She knew that there would be plenty of time for her and her followers to explore the many wonders of the world later. She's changed little since those earlier days, and she and her followers delight in exploring the world.<ref name="CSp162">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|162}}</ref><ref name="ISWG-220">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|220}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Desna is an ancient goddess of freedom and luck, and is credited with the creation of the heavens. According to the ''[[Windsong Testaments]]'', she was one of the first eight deities of this incarnation of [[Great Beyond|reality]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Windsong Testaments: The Three Fears of Pharasma|page=Paizo Blog|author=[[James Jacobs]]|date=October 31, 2019|url=https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgzu}}</ref>

In her earliest days, the god [[Curchanus]], an enemy of the goddess [[Lamashtu]], was her mentor. Lamashtu laid a trap for Curchanus and stripped him of his beast domain, ripping it from his godly essence. As he died, he gifted Desna with the domain of travel; she has traveled the planes and worlds since, opposing both oppression and Lamashtu wherever she encounters them, and spreading her word while making an effort to experience new wonders when she can.<ref name="CSp162"/><ref name="PF2p66">{{Cite book/The Skinsaw Murders|66|66&ndash;75}}</ref>

=== Battle against Rovagug ===

During the [[Age of Creation]], Desna was among the original gods who battled the [[Rovagug|Rough Beast]] who sought to destroy Golarion, and were eventually able to contain him in the [[Dead Vault]].<ref name="ISWG-216">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|216}}</ref>

=== Creating and freeing deities ===

[[File:Desna and Ghlaunder.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Desna rebukes the awakened [[Ghlaunder]].]]

Perhaps by chance, Desna has been involved in the creation or freeing of a number of minor deities. She is said to accidentally have freed [[Ghlaunder]], the [[mosquito]] god of infection and parasites, from his cocoon on the [[Ethereal Plane]].<ref name="ISWG-228">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|228&ndash;229}}</ref> She has a half-mortal son with [[Cayden Cailean]] named [[Kurgess]], and together they raised him to godhood.<ref name="ISWG-229">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|229}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|162}}</ref>  She is said to have accidentally created [[Black Butterfly]] by a pattern she unwittingly placed in the stars. The [[empyreal lord]] is even known as "Desna's Shadow".<ref name="CotR-9">{{Cite book/Chronicle of the Righteous|9}}</ref>

=== Invasion of the Abyss ===

{{See also|Aolar}}

A vengeful Desna killed the [[demon lord]] [[Aolar]], known as the Lady of the Hunt, and destroyed her [[Abyss]]al fortress in [[4155 AR]]<ref name="PF99-48">{{Cite book/Dance of the Damned|48}}</ref> after the Lady of the Hunt took control of the body of a recently deceased Desnan priestess to wreak death on the priestess' loved ones. This possession of heroes just after their deaths was Aolar's penchant, especially when the dead person's [[soul]] could witness the suffering caused.

Aolar made many enemies in this way, including [[Calistria]], [[Sarenrae]], and [[Shelyn]], who all helped Desna in her vengeance. Calistria's aid especially was key, as Desna's flagrant act nearly started a [[plane|planar]] war: Calistria's politicking turned the allied demonic host, the [[Coalition of Chaos]], against itself and averted an interplanar battle.

== Appearance ==

Desna is a [[Varisian]] goddess often described as a beautiful [[elf|elven]] woman, with butterfly wings containing all the beauty of a clear night sky. She is often depicted as having dark hair, silvery eyes, and a coy but distant smile, wearing diaphanous gowns and sometimes accompanied by swarms of butterflies.<ref name="CSp162"/><ref name="PF2p66"/>

Additional details vary among the races that worship her; the [[Bonuwat]] people of the [[Mwangi Expanse]] worship a variant form of Desna, a janiform amalgam with [[Gozreh]] that they call [[Shimye-Magalla]].<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|29}}</ref> The nomadic [[Kellid]]s of northern [[Avistan]] depict Desna not as the elegant elven woman, but a stately [[human]] woman riding an elk.<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|27}}</ref> The ancient [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] sometimes depicted her as a single star.<ref name="BM-23">{{Cite book/Black Markets|23}}</ref>

== Relationships ==
[[File:Prismatic Ray.jpg|300px|thumb|Desna, Sarenrae and Shelyn.]]
Desna is strongly opposed to Lamashtu due to the murder of Desna's one-time mentor, and wishes to reclaim the domain of beasts. She also actively hunts the demigod [[Ghlaunder]], the Gossamer King, whom legends claim she accidentally freed from his cocoon.<ref>{{Cite book/Faiths of Corruption|19}}</ref> Cayden Cailean is known to be a suitor of hers, but she keeps aloof of most godly affairs; past traumas and her desire for freedom lead her into fewer interactions with other deities than most. She is involved in a polyamorous relationship with Sarenrae and Shelyn, and opposes both [[Rovagug]] and [[Zon-Kuthon]] for control of the night, which she wishes to be a time of wonder and beauty.<ref name="PF2p66"/><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|75}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|164}}</ref> [[Night hag|Night hags]] are known to bear an undying hatred for Desna and go out of their way to torment her followers, if possible even trying to steal their souls.<ref name="CHR-p37">{{Cite book/Classic Horrors Revisited|37}}</ref>

Desna is friendly with [[Elion]], but his worshippers often found hers too flighty and unfocused to make discoveries. Nevertheless, the relationship between the two faiths improved as Elion's followers became interested in [[space travel]]. Despite their differences, Desna was friendly with [[Acavna]]; their devotees shared a holiday when the full [[Moon (Golarion)|moon]] appeared near a particular [[constellation]], which was said to represent Desna and Acavna meeting and sharing stories.<ref name="PF123-68">{{Cite book/The Flooded Cathedral|68}}</ref>

Desna has long been an enemy of [[Xhamen-Dor]], but she knows that spreading lore of the Inmost Blot will empower it, so very few Desnans actively oppose Xhamen-Dor.<ref>{{Cite book/What Grows Within|66}}</ref>

== Realm ==

Unlike most of the other deities, Desna has no true realm in the [[Great Beyond]], although she does occasionally travel to a small castle that floats above the rugged beauty of [[Elysium]].<ref>{{Cite book/The Great Beyond|36}}</ref> Her true home [[Cynosure]], a [[demiplane]] manifested on the [[Material Plane]] as a bright silvery-blue star. Her palace, the [[Sevenfold Cynosure]], rests at the plane's heart, and exists simultaneously in Elysium and Cynosure when Desna wills it to manifest in Elysium.<ref>{{Cite book/Distant Worlds|50}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|168}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|211}}</ref> 

== Providence ==

Desna generally communicates with her followers through dreams, sending images, feelings, or even prophecies that stick in the recipient's mind after waking. If there is not enough time for dreams, or they are otherwise unsuitable, she can send swarms of butterflies, sparrows, dragonflies, or geese that fly in a four-pointed star shape. When displeased, she can withhold a restful sleep, make sure the mortal gets sore feet, has a travel accident, or that a messenger animal loses its way.<ref name="ISG-45">{{Cite book/Inner Sea Gods|45&ndash;46}}</ref>

== Servants ==

[[File:Meeting Longdreamer.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Meeting a star monarch: servants of Desna]]

Desna and her faithful hold creatures that symbolize freedom and the night sky as beautiful and holy. Butterflies are a particular favorite, and the appearance of swarms of them is often seen as a sign of the goddess' favor. Other favored creatures include the [[azata]]s, [[alien]]s, [[cynosoma]]s, [[star monarch]]s, and certain [[fey]] creatures of the night.<ref name="PF2p66"/><ref>{{Cite book/Inner Sea Bestiary|50}}</ref><ref name="ISG-275">{{cite book/Inner Sea Gods|275}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|229}}</ref> Her [[divine servitor|divine servitor race]] are the [[thyrlien]]s, winged azatas who watch over those traveling by night and who are the warrior counterparts of the gentler lyrakien.<ref name="ISG-285">{{cite book/Inner Sea Gods|285}}</ref>

=== Unique servants ===

Some of Mother Moon's known servants include:

; [[Nightspear]]: This black and silver spotted [[avoral]] is a fierce ally of the Desnan clergy, and often sings in battle.<ref name="PF2p66"/>
; [[Sorrowbrand]]: A dramatic [[lillend]] composer with black, star-dappled scales and feathers, Sorrowbrand wears many black ribbons and enjoys inspiring mortal songs.<ref name="PF2p66"/>
; [[Night Monarch|The Night Monarch]]: Appearing as a massive butterfly-like creature the size of a dragon, the night monarch is the [[herald]] of Desna.<ref name="PF2p66"/>

== Church of Desna  ==

[[File:Stargazer.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A stargazer [[cleric]] of Desna.]]

Desna is the goddess of travel and journeys, and there are few who traverse the roads who wouldn't spare her a prayer or a simple-worded plea for benediction. Scouts, sailors, and those who travel for travel's sake make up a large number of her followers, though her focus on luck also makes her a favorite deity among gamblers and thieves. Whatever their calling, followers of the Song of Spheres search the world for new experiences, and try to live their life to the fullest.<ref name="CSp162"/><ref name="PF2p66"/><ref name="ISWG-220"/>

The church of Desna has few temples, as its priests rarely settle in a single location. The faithful of the Great Dreamer can be found on the roads of [[Golarion]], and especially among the Varisian caravans and others who who call the road their home and enjoy the beauty of the wilderness. Other centers of worship include the elves of [[Kyonin]], the [[Lands of the Linnorm Kings]], [[Nidal]] (where her worship is forbidden), [[Numeria]], the [[River Kingdoms]], the [[Steaming Sea]], and [[Ustalav]].<ref name="ISWG-178">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|178}}</ref><ref name="CSp162"/><ref name="PF2p66"/> She is also revered by numerous Kellids,<ref name="ISWG-16">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|16}}</ref> Mwangi,<ref name="ISWG-17">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|17}}</ref> [[Shoanti]],<ref name="ISWG-18">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|18}}</ref> [[Tian]],<ref name="ISWG-20">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|20}}</ref> [[Ulfen]],<ref name="ISWG-21">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|21}}</ref> Varisians,<ref name="ISWG-22">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|22}}</ref> elves,<ref name="ISWG-25">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|25}}</ref> [[gnome]]s,<ref name="ISWG-26">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|26}}</ref> and [[half-elf|half-elves]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].<ref name="ISWG-28">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|28}}</ref>

=== Crown of the World ===

Hundreds of years ago, a clan of tundra nomads called the [[Uqtaal]] worshipped Desna as the Queen of the North Star at the [[Crown of the World]]. They believed she protected them during the long arctic nights, that at the time of death, their [[soul]]s would travel to the [[Cynosure|North Star]] to be with her. They built the [[Uqtaal Necropolis]] at the base of the [[Wall of Heaven Mountains]] with a passage called the [[Path of Spirits]] that led souls onto the [[High Ice]], and then from there to the [[North Pole]], guided by the North Star. There Desna would find them and take their soul to their final resting place in the stars. Unfortunately, the Uqtaal clans eventually were corrupted to the worship of [[Fumeiyoshi]] and forsook Desna.<ref>{{Cite book/The Hungry Storm|43}}</ref>

=== Halflings ===

Desna is held in special affection by many [[halfling]]s, especially those who travel or seek adventure. Traveling halflings take tokens of the goddess and frequent her shrines along their journey.<ref>{{Cite book/Halflings of Golarion|17}}</ref> They attribute their special luck and some halflings' ability to [[jinx]] as a gift from the goddess. This luck is personified in the goddess [[Chaldira Zuzaristan]], who halflings believe is Desna's loyal friend.<ref>{{Cite book/Halflings of Golarion|17&ndash;18}}</ref>

=== Nidal ===

Because of their goddess' adversarial relationship with Zon-Kuthon, worshipers of the Song of Stars have long tried to infiltrate the Kuthonite nation of Nidal. Even though the worship of any other deity in that nation is illegal, Desnans have had some success in northern Nidal, in a region known as the [[Atteran Ranches]]. When the central government in [[Pangolais]] discovered this and was about to intervene, the great ranching families of the area held them off by promising to take care of the problem themselves. They formed posses of mercenaries called [[dream hunters]] to track down and eliminate any Densa-worshipers.<ref>{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|135}}</ref>

=== River Kingdoms ===

The [[Nomen centaur]]s of the [[River Kingdoms]] worship Desna in an aspect called Mother Moon.<ref>{{Cite book/The Varnhold Vanishing|33}}</ref>

=== Tian Xia ===

In [[Tian Xia]], Desna is known as the Resplendent Goddess of Fortune, and the Goddess of the North Star.<ref>{{Cite book/Master of Devils|33}}</ref><ref name="DEG-59">{{Cite book/Dragon Empires Gazetteer|59}}</ref>

=== Ancient Azlant ===

Ancient [[Azlanti (human ethnicity)|Azlanti]] vagabonds and idealists, who rarely stayed in one place for long, worshiped Desna as a goddess of stars before she was gifted the travel domain. Her faith has otherwise remained largely unchanged from the [[Age of Legend]] to the modern day. Itinerant Desnans charted the circuit of stars and interpreted the dreams of wanderers who stayed the night in their shrines.<ref name="PF123-68"/><ref>{{Cite book/City of Seven Spears|47}}</ref>

Shrines to Desna dotted the roads of Azlant and hostels across the empire's cities. Few were large or elaborate, and some congregations even carried their shrines on nomadic wagons.<ref name="PF123-68"/>

=== Clergy ===

[[File:Priestess of Desna.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A Desnan priestess.]]

The informal clergy of Desna is primarily composed of [[cleric]]s, though on occasion [[bard]]s are called by some song or whisper in the night to follow her path. In addition, [[spherewalker]]s are paragons of the Desnan ideal: they see new sights each day and discover unheard of locales.<ref name="CSp162"/><ref name="PF2p66"/><ref name="ISWG-220"/>

Her clergy usually garb themselves in white robes with black trim and [[silk]] caps, highlighted by varied decorative elements (especially among priests of high status), and usually accompanied by one or more [[starknife|starknives]].<ref name="CSp162"/><ref name="PF2p66"/>

[[File:Shrine to Desna.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A shrine to Desna.]]
=== Temples and shrines === 

Temples of Desna are few and far between, with most locations no more than roadside shrines erected in her honor. Travelers often leave markings and dedications in newly discovered areas and secluded locales. Those few temples that do exist often serve as observatories and are open to the night sky,<ref name="CSp162"/> with plentiful texts, charts, and instruments to help track the stars and determine astronomical events.<ref name="ISWG-220"/>

Dedicated to the faith of Desna, seven bell towers are believed to have existed at one point throughout the [[Inner Sea]]. The seven towers represented the [[Seven Towers (Desna)|Seven Towers]] of Desna's palace and each tower housed a sacred ''[[Bell of Mercy]]''. Pilgrimages to all seven towers were often undertaken by Desna's faithful.<ref>{{Cite book/Demon's Heresy|62}}</ref>

=== Holy texts ===

Writings sacred to Desna tend to be easily portable, written in simple language and often containing references to exotic, beautiful places and roads containing a shrine.<ref name="PF2p66"/>

; [[The Eight Scrolls]]: These writings detail Desna's early days and the basic edicts of her faith.<ref name="CSp162"/><ref name="PF2p66"/>
; Shrine Wall Writings: Almost all Desnan shrines are covered with the observations and prayers of travelers and priests of her faith, containing the wisdom of the road and hints for the start of new journeys.<ref name="PF2p66"/>

=== Holidays ===

The spring month of [[Desnus]] is named in honor of the goddess, although it is not a [[holiday]].<ref name="ISWG-248">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|248}}</ref>

; [[Ritual of Stardust]]: This holiday takes place on both the winter and summer solstices. When the ceremonial fires burn low, the faithful throw sand mixed with gems into the embers and make wishes and pledges for the months to come.<ref name="PF2p66"/>
; [[Swallowtail Festival]]: Every year on the first day of the month of [[Rova]], the followers of Desna release cages full of [[butterfly|swallowtail butterflies]], an act that honors a story told by the faithful.<ref name="PF2p66"/>

=== Favored animals ===

Gods are often associated with certain [[animal]]s, either because they possess a quality that the god favors, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to it. Desna's favored animals include butterflies, [[moth]]s, [[caterpillar]]s, [[owl]]s, [[sparrow]]s, [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], and [[bird|messenger birds]].<ref name="AA-ibc">{{Cite book/Animal Archive|inside back cover}}</ref>
