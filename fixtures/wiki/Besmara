'''Besmara''' (pronounced bes-MAR-uh),<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|246}}</ref> also known as the '''Pirate Queen''', is a goddess most commonly worshiped by the sailor-folk of the [[Shackles]] or [[Ilizmagorti]]. She is said to captain her legendary ship ''[[Seawraith]]'' throughout the seas and waterways of the [[Great Beyond]] (especially the [[Maelstrom]]), making raids on places such as [[Hell]], [[Elysium]], [[Axis]], and [[Heaven]]. Pirates don't tend to be a very religious lot, and generally only call on her on their death bed or if in extreme danger. Those few [[cleric|priests]] who do devote themselves to her generally also are captains of their own raiding ships and have a fierce reputation. Her symbol is the jolly roger, a universal emblem of piracy, normally a white skull and crossbones on a black field.<ref name="CS-170">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|170&ndash;171}}</ref>
