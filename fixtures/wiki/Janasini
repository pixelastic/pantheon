'''Janasini''' is the mother of [[bird]]s, and thus of the noble [[garuda]]s.<ref name="OG">{{Cite web

== History ==

Legend tells that Janasini made an unwise wager with her sister [[Ravithra]], the [[goddess]] of [[naga]]s and [[snake]]s. Ravithra cheated, and Janasini lost and became the [[slave]] of Ravithra's naga children. [[Sudachala]], the first of Janasini's garuda children, offered to complete any task to free his mother. The nagas demanded a legendary bowl of nectar said to rest atop the tallest mountain in [[Vudra]]. Sudachala flew to the mountain and overcame many obstacles to retrieve the bowl, as detailed in the ''[[Azvadeva Pujila]]''.<ref name="OG"/>

As Sudachala flew back, the god [[Gruhastha]] appeared and told Sudachala that the nectar was the elixir of [[immortality]]. The wicked nagas had tried to trick Sudachala into stealing the elixir from the gods' hiding place so they could drink it and live forever.<ref name="OG"/>

Sudachala alighted in front of the waiting nagas, placing the bowl on some sedge grass, and the nagas freed Janasini from servitude. But when the nagas tried to drink from the bowl, they cut their tongues on the sharp grass, for as Sudachala and Gruhastha had planned, the god had whisked the true elixir away, leaving only an [[illusion]] in its place.<ref name="OG"/>

Since then, garudas have been the mortal enemies of nagas. Only the most depraved and outcast garuda would knowingly associate with any kind of [[aberration|aberrant]] serpent.<ref name="OG"/>

== Vudra ==

Janasini can be assumed to be worshiped widely in Vudra, though the extent of that worship is only vaguely understood.<ref name="OG"/>
