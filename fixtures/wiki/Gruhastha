[[File:Gruhastha.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A depiction of Gruhastha holding a [[book]].]]

'''Gruhastha''' is a male [[Vudra]]n [[god]].<ref name="PCCS39box">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|39}}</ref> He was a [[mortal]] nephew of [[Irori]] who, according to legend, [[ascension|ascended]] to divinity by authoring a [[book]] so perfectly profound that he merged with it and became a god&mdash;the ''[[Azvadeva Pujila]]''.<ref name="FoG-18">{{Cite book/Faiths of Golarion|18}}</ref>

{{Stub}}

== Role ==

Gruhastha is called the Keeper as he keeps watch over [[Golarion]] until enough beings reach enlightenment, at which point the world would itself become part of [[Nirvana]].<ref name="PCCS39box"/>

== Relationships ==

Gruhastha is the nephew of Irori and an ally of the Master of Masters in the role of his advisor.<ref name="PCCS39box"/><ref name="FoG-18">{{Cite book/Faiths of Golarion|18}}</ref>

== Church ==

=== Holy text ===

Gruhasthans consider all books to be [[holy]], but none surpasses the ''Azvadeva Pujila'', which is both an incarnation of Gruhastha himself and his greatest work of text. The work is relatively informal for a holy book and full of fables, each with layers of hidden wisdom.<ref name="FoG-20">{{Cite book/Faiths of Golarion|20}}</ref>

=== Holidays ===

; [[Azvadeva Dejal]]: Annually on 3 Desnus, worshipers mark the revelation of the ''Azvadeva Pujila'' by gifting books, celebrating knowledge, blessing [[animal]]s, and enjoying a vegetarian feast.<ref name="FoG-20"/>

== References ==

[[Paizo]] published major articles about Gruhastha in ''[[Faiths of Golarion]]'' and ''[[Lost Omens Gods & Magic]]''.
